Hello, you are watching Vats Uvach and I am Mukesh Vats. Friends, we are very close to 
the end of 2024 and a new year 2025 is just about to start. Some questions, some 
apprehensions and some hopes exist in everyone's mind, everyone thinks how will the new 
year be for me, will my wishes be fulfilled in it or will I have to struggle and so on.

At the end of the year, there is a demand from viewers to make the predictions for the 
next year on priority. So from today we are starting this series, I will tell you about 
each zodiac sign one after the other. When these 12 zodiac signs will be completed, 
according to Saturn's transit in 2025, I will give you separate videos for the signs 
affected by The Sadhe-Sati and Dhaiyya. This is a series of about 17 videos, so stay 
tuned to this channel.

In today's video, we are going to discuss 2025 for Aries moonsign and ascendant people. 
Friends, whenever we talk about the whole year, we assess the four slow moving planets, 
like Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. In today's video I will also include Mars because 
it is the lord of Aries and I will also tell you some very simple remedies, so stay 
tuned till the end of the video.

First of all, you see on the screen, when the year will start on January 1, if you are 
an Aries Native, then the position of the planets will be something like this: Your Lord 
Mars will be debilitated. Saturn, the lord of your 10th and 11th house, will be in your 
11th house and Jupiter, the lord of your luck house, will be retrograde in your second 
house. You can also see the position of all the other planets. Moon will be in 
Capricorn, Sun will be in Sagittarius etc.

Now first let us assess the results as per Jupiter, what kind of results will you get 
this whole year? Jupiter is a very important planet for you people because it is your 
9th Lord, the lord of your luck. Jupiter will be in your second house till the middle 
of May, from there he will aspect your sixth and eighth and 10th house. Jupiter in the 
second house is considered good and from 2024 May, Jupiter has been giving good results 
to you people.

In the beginning of this year, Jupiter will be retrograde but after February 9, Jupiter 
will become direct and in the last four months of this transit, this is a good time for 
earning money. Jupiter in the second house will make your speech very effective and will 
increase your family. The increase in your family can either be through the birth of new 
children or someone in the house can get married or you too may get married.

Jupiter will be aspecting the 6th, 8th and 10th. Some career related developments may 
also take place during this time. You will get along well with people from the 
government side and due to this, your government work will be accomplished. In May 
Jupiter will move to your third house. Jupiter in the third house is not considered very 
good and is also not friendly with Mercury in whose zodiac it will move but Jupiter's 
aspect has nectar in it.

Sitting from here, Jupiter will look at your important houses - 7th, 9th and 11th. The 
path of marriage will be paved for those who are not married because your 7th is being 
activated. If there is a conjunction of transit Jupiter with Venus or Mars in your 
horoscope, then marriage will definitely happen. If you are a man and in your horoscope 
there is any relationship between this transit Jupiter with your natal Venus, then you 
will get married.

Similarly, if you are a woman and there is a relationship between this transit Jupiter 
with your natal Mars, then there will be possibilities of marriage for you too. 
Obviously, you should be of marriageable age. Apart from this, Jupiter, sitting in the 
third aspects the Ninth. Some of you will get the benefit of short and long journeys 
during this time. You can also go on religious trips.

The aspect of Jupiter on the ninth will increase your interest towards spirituality and 
religion. If you are a student associated with higher education or associated with 
spirituality, then this time will be very suitable for you. Father's blessings will be 
with you. If there has been any misunderstanding etc. with your father, then it will 
end.

Prior to this, Jupiter was aspecting your sixth and eighth house. If there are any 
health related problems, especially the problems of laziness, obesity and cholesterol, 
you will get relief from these problems. Jupiter will also have an eye on 11th house, 
hence it will be a gainful transit. Some people may get new opportunities. New 
investment opportunities will be available and it will be beneficial.

But Jupiter will not stay in the 3rd house for very long. In October itself, Jupiter 
will move to your fourth house. Jupiter will stay in the 4th house for a short period, 
for about two months. It will increase your happiness and satisfaction levels. For some 
people, it may be time to buy a new house, new vehicle etc. Some people may get 
promotion in job etc. After this, Jupiter will be retrograde and will be in your 3rd 
house again.

Jupiter will provide benefits to your younger siblings and your elder siblings. You will 
also get good benefits from your superiors. Jupiter is getting 'Atichari', it will be 
touching your three houses in the same year. So, you will see the results very quickly 
but Jupiter is aspecting the good houses, hence you will get good effects.

If you want to make Jupiter stronger then there is a small mantra, 'Om Gram Greem Graum 
Sah Guruve Namah': If you recite one rosary of this mantra daily then Jupiter will give 
you very good results. Let's talk about Saturn, another slow moving and a very important 
planet for you. It is important because he is the lord of your career and the house of 
Gains and for the last five years, Saturn is moving in your karma and profit house 
itself.

The last five years must have been very good years for you for opportunities and 
progress. Till March 29, Saturn is still in your profit house. So Jupiter in the wealth 
house and Saturn in the house of gains, there will be abundance of income till March. 
But after March 29, Saturn will transit your 12th house. If your ascendant is Aries 
then Saturn will be in the 12th house and if it is Aries Moonsign then Sade Sati will 
start for you people.

Sade Sati has returned for Aries moonsign natives after 30 years, so this will bring 
some new challenges. There is nothing to be afraid of, I will give you a separate video 
related to this. When Saturn's Sade Sati starts, it gives mental tension. Even if your 
ascendant is Aries, Saturn in 12th house is not considered very good, and one situation 
will arise from 30th March to 18th May - both Saturn and Rahu will be together in your 
12th house.

So from 30th March to 18th May, for about 51 days, you should be very careful. 
Incidents of fraud may happen during this time, you may get defamed. Avoid doing any 
impulsive work during this time because Saturn is the lord of your career and Rahu is 
Illusions, Maya. Do not start any work on impulse under the spell of Rahu, otherwise 
you will get into trouble.

Avoid doing any important deal in these 50-51 days. Take great care of your character. 
Be very careful about your habits and if you remain spiritual then it will be very easy 
for you to navigate these 50 days. Saturn in 12th is good for people living abroad, who 
are into business with foreign countries, have any kind of relation with foreign 
countries, work in a multinational corporation, who are travel agents in the field of 
sending people abroad.

But Saturn in 12th house will increase mental tension, sleep issues might arise. From 
here Saturn will aspect at your second house. It may make you too direct in your 
speech. There will be lack of diplomacy. You will become too straight forward and when 
this happens, it spoils relations. Sometimes being too outspoken also becomes a cause 
of danger. Because of speech problems may arise in the family. Keep this thing in mind.

Saturn is also aspecting the sixth house, creating new enemies. There may also be a 
case litigation. Sitting in the 12th, Saturn is aspecting the sixth. You may face 
health related challenges, so you will have to take care of these things. Saturn while 
sitting in the 12th will also aspect the Ninth House. This is a good time for 
traveling but one should go on trips with complete planning.

Since the 10th lord is in the 12th, for some people it means a shift in career is 
possible or it may also happen that you might be in the same company but your profile, 
your work place, your table will change. If there is Saturn in 12th house then there 
is nothing to fear too much but yes one thing is certain - when Saturn is in your 12th 
house, whether moonsign or ascendant, it will increase your hustle and bustle.
